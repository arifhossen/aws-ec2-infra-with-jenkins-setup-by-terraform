### 7. Unlock Jenkins  

After Jenkins is installed, you need to unlock it to complete the setup. The initial admin password is stored in a file on the server. Follow these steps to retrieve it:  

#### Step 1: Connect to the EC2 Instance  
Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:  
```bash
ssh -i jenkins-server-KeyPair-dev.pem ubuntu@<instance-public-ip>
```  

#### Step 2: Retrieve the Initial Admin Password  
The initial admin password is stored in the following file:  
```
/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```  

Run the following command to view the password:  
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```  

#### Step 3: Unlock Jenkins  
1. Copy the password displayed in the terminal.  
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:  
   ```
   http://<instance-public-ip>:8080
   ```  
3. Paste the password into the "Administrator password" field and click **Continue**.  

#### Step 4: Complete Jenkins Setup  
1. Install the recommended plugins or select specific ones based on your requirements.  
2. Create an admin user for Jenkins.  
3. Finalize the setup and start using Jenkins.  

**Note:**  
- Ensure port `8080` is open in your security group to allow web access to Jenkins.  
- Store the admin password securely if needed for future reference.  
```
